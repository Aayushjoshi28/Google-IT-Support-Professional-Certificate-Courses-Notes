### Basics of Netowrking Devices:
#### Cables
The most common forms of copper twisted pair cables used in networking are Cat5, Cat5e, and Cat6 (categories) cables.
Cat5e cables have mostly replaced those older Cat5 cables because their internals reduce crosstalk. Crosstalk is when an electrical pulse on one wire is accidentally detected on another wire. So, the receiving end isn't able to understand the data causing a network error.
The second primary form of networking cable is known as Fiber, short for fiber optic cables. Fiber cables contain individual optical fibers which are tiny tubes made out of glass about the width of a human hair. These tubes of glass can transport beams of light. Unlike copper, which uses electrical voltages, fiber cables use pulses of light to represent the ones and zeros of the underlying data. Fiber is even sometimes used specifically in environments where there's a lot of electromagnetic interference from outside sources because this can impact data being sent across copper wires.
#### Hubs and Switches
A hub is a physical layer device that allows for connections from many computers at once. This causes noise on the network and causes a collision domain. A collision domain is a network segment where only one device can communicate at a time. If multiple systems try sending data at the same time, the electrical pulses sent across the cable can interfere with each other. This causes these systems to have to wait for a quiet period before they try sending their data again.
A switch is very similar to a hub, since you can connect many devices to it so they can communicate. __The difference is that while a hub is a layer 1 or physical layer device, a switch is a level 2__ or data link device. This means that a switch can actually inspect the contents of the Ethernet protocol data being sent around the network, determine which system the data is intended for and then only send that data to that one system.
#### Routers
A router is a device that knows how to forward data between independent networks. __A router operates at layer three, a network layer.__
Routers store internal tables containing information about how to route traffic between lots of different networks all over the world.
The most common type of router you'll see is one for a home network, or a small office. These devices generally don't have very detailed routing tables. The purpose of these routers is mainly just to take traffic originating from inside the home, or office LAN, and to forward it along to the ISP. 
#### Servers and Clients
